# Setup

This document outlines the basic setup procedure, which includes
installing dependencies and setting environment variables.

## Setup Project

First, setup Git and clone the repository on your development machine.
Make sure you have Python3 (3.3 or 3.4 should work), pip, and virtualenv.
Virtualenvwrapper is also recommended but not necessary.

You will need to make a new virtualenv that uses Python3 and then
activate that enviroment. `cd` into the root directory of the project
and run `pip install -r requirements/development.txt`. This might take
a few minutes. Make sure everything installs without errors. You may be
asked to install some other dependencies using your OS's package manager.
